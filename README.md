## BACI Surface State Vector
Maxim Chernetskiy, Mathias Disney 2018
WP2 Consistent EO datasets across space, time and wavelength 


This code creates the BACI Surface State Vector (SSV) files in netCDF format. SSV consists of surface reflectance, albedo, land surface temperature (LST) and synthetic apperture radar (SAR) backscatter. All datasets have the same spatial resolution, geographical projection and temporal step.
Datasets can be found in /group_workspaces/jasmin2/baci/sigil/baci_wp2_files/
All regional sites which are in the geographical Europe are in the same folder /group_workspaces/jasmin2/baci/sigil/baci_wp2_files/13_europe/
Datasets are in sinusoidal projection and divided by MODIS tiles https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html This means that processed regions are larger than BACI regional sites.
